## Purpose

This section covers the code and content for formatting your pages, organizing your data, and using markdown to convey your options to users clearly.

## too long; didn't read

Quick guidelines:
- [Headers]({{< relref "01markdown.md#headers" >}})
  - H1 headers are generally not needed, but are used for the page title
  - H2 headers begin a new section in a page
  - H3 headers highlight action items for the user
  - H4 headers are for subsections within sections
  - H5 headers may be used at your discretion as needed
  - H6 headers are used to title tables and images
- Use [Horizontal Rules]({{< relref "01markdown.md#horizontal-rules" >}}) to break up sections
- Use **Bold** text when a user should click that option in the UI
- Use [inline code]({{< relref "03format/01markdown.md#code-and-cli" >}}) when referencing a cli command or syntax
  - **Not when instructing users to type it!**
- Use [code blocks]({{< relref "03format/01markdown.md#indented-code-block" >}}) when providing long commands for user, and when capturing CLI output.
