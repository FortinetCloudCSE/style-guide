###### Markdown
- [Headers]({{< relref "01markdown.md#headers" >}})
  - H1 headers are not needed on index pages, but should be used once per chapter at the top of the page
  - H2 headers begin a new section in a page
  - H3 headers highlight action items for the user
  - H4 headers are for subsections within sections
  - H5 headers may be used at your discretion as needed
  - H6 headers are used to title tables and images
- Use [Horizontal Rules]({{< relref "01markdown.md#horizontal-rules" >}}) to break up sections
- Use **Bold** text when a user should click that option in the UI
- Use [inline code]({{< relref "03format/01markdown.md#code-and-cli" >}}) when referencing a CLI command or syntax
  - **Not when instructing users to type it!**
- Use [code blocks]({{< relref "03format/01markdown.md#indented-code-block" >}}) when providing commands for user input, as well as when capturing CLI output.
