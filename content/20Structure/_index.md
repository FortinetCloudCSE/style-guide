# Technical Writing

This section is meant to provide guidelines around how to write, reference, and explain the technical pieces. These again are only **guidelines** and are meant to provide clarity when there is none. If there is something written here that contradicts other advice or references elsewhere, this document can and should be modified. 

- The **grammar** section covers the grammatical nuance of writing. 
- **Voice and tone** explains how to speak as Fortinet, through your written words. 
- **Audience and Personas** helps to find the audience you're writing for. 
- The **structure** section then outlines best practices in storing your files within your repository, how to structure your guide, and how to best build out your individual chapters for effective learning.
